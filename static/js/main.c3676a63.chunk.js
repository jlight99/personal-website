sticky, the facilities looked worn, and there was a sour smell in the air... i also got to experience european washrooms for the first time. to use the washrooms in the airport, you actually had to pay to get in. there was an actual ticket barrier-like mechanism blocking the entrance, with a slot for you to drop euros in. as it turns out paid washrooms are pretty commonplace in europe, but having grown up in north america, i was pretty shook. another issue was the sheer size of the airport. it felt like we walked for a solid half hour at least. i've visited a few airports before, but those airports were either small enough that walking between terminals wasn't really an issue, or of equal or greater size to the cdg airport, but with some more efficient intra-terminal transportation system in place, like a train travelling between terminals."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"anyway, once we left the airport, things started looking up. there are several options to get from the cdg airport into the city. one option is the roissybus, a direct bus that stops at several of the airport terminals to pick up passengers before driving straight to its destination of paris opera with no stops along the way. another choice is the rer train, which is essentially a parisian express subway, and also travels between the airport and the city but makes stops along the way. we opted for the roissybus since it was aboveground and we wanted to observe the city. a second reason was, based on what we read online, there were mentions that the rer train stopped at certain districts in paris that were reputed to be more sketchy, and we didn't want to take chances."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"it was definitely a good choice. looking out the window as the bus drove into the city was probably the coolest part of the trip up to that point. i was really caught off guard by how different the cars driving around on the road were. back in canada, a sample of a typical set of cars you'd see on the road are ford f150s, nissan rogues, toyota corollas, honda civics, hyundai elantras... essentially, pickup trucks, suvs, and passenger cars. i saw none of those on the road. in fact, i barely recognized any of the brands of the cars on the road, let alone their models. the few mercedes and bmws speeding by and the toyota prius taxicabs reassured me that i wasn't entirely car-illiterate. by the end of the paris trip though, i'd learned to recognize several of the main car manufacturers, including renault, peugeot and citroen (which are all, surprise surpise, based in france). and it wasn't just the different brands and models of cars that surprised me, it was also the sheer size of the cars. there were fewer pickup suvs, almost no pickup trucks in sight, and the cars in general seemed a size smaller. after some googling, i learned that the smaller car sizes in france may be an economical choice, to counteract the higher fuel prices in europe."),n.a.createElement("p",null,"the roissybus dropped us off next to the paris opera, and we took a metro from there to our hotel. when we arrived at the hotel, it was still before check-in

like coffee. the way the coffee was served was pretty cool too. we each got a cup on a tray with a spoon, and the cup was mostly empty, except for a bit of very concentrated coffee at the bottom. along with the mostly-empty cup of coffee came a jug of warm milk, filled all the way to the top. from the stirring spoon on the tray, we deduced that we were meant to pour the milk into the cup to mix with the coffee. after finishing the cup of coffee, there was more than enough milk left over to drink another cup of milk. the croissants too were heavenly. the best part was that they were served warm. the shell of the croissant was slightly crispy, but when i broke into the interior the folds were soft and buttery. i was also a bit surprised to see the croissants straight. i'd grown up eating costco croissants, which are crescent-shaped. some online researched revealed that in fact, straight croissants are made using 100% butter, whereas curved croissants could be made with

wikipedia tells me is \"a fresh Italian cow milk cheese made from mozzarella and cream\", and more specifically, the outer shell is solid mozzarella, and the inside is stracciatella and cream. the cheese by itself tasted a bit plain, but it complemented the tomato-dominated flavour of the ratatouille really well. in fact, the entire ratatouille was amazing, and also a much-needed source of
